The Place Where Cool Shit Come From

Welcome to my secret location. Here I think I can release things in a safer way, and to be honest take advantage of the tools that are available. This is a personal way to know that this is me, and to know that you are getting the swag straight from the author. 

I don't think that doxing is needed for a project. Especially if it is one that isn't trying to be huge. I want to make a project that is not the convential. Something in the clouds, and down to earth. 

I personally just want to make things in this space that people can see and know that a real person wanted to make this. I don't want to be famous, or popular. I just want to showcase this in a way that people can know that they can do this too. That is my primary mission. To insprire others in the same dynamics that have inspired me. 

I was always the guys that would try to figure things out, and honestly I never had a choice in the tools that were given. I had to work with what I had. That is what I want to inspire is that as long as you have a good idea and you want to make it for anyone. Make it for yourself first.
